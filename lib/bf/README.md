# BF - BrainFuck module

## Description:

This is the BrainFuck module of the emulator.

It parses the input into a simplified, optimized, internal form which a backend will execute.

The backends present are:
- interpreter - simply execute the instructions as is.
- (TODO:) compiler - compiles the result into native code.
    - (optional:) static executables?
